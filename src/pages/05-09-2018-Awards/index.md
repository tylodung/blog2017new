The six-time Emmy nominee and two-time Critics' Choice Award winner reflects on why her agents fired her after she agreed to play Joan, how she feels about all the attention paid to her figure and why she decided to follow a period drama with a contemporary network dramedy

"I love television, so I was never against going on to another series," says the actress Christina Hendricks, who is best known for playing Joan Holloway (later Joan Harris), a Madison Avenue advertising agency’s office manager who claws her way up the corporate food-chain over the course of seven seasons on AMC’s landmark drama series Mad Men, as we sit down at the offices of The Hollywood Reporter to record an episode of THR's 'Awards Chatter' podcast. The 42-year-old, whose work on that show garnered her six Emmy nominations for best supporting actress in a drama series and two Critics' Choice Award nominations — and wins — in that same category, emphasizes, "I just wanted it to be the right one."
Mad Men aired its final episode on May 17, 2015. Less than three years later, on Feb. 26, 2018, Hendricks began starring in another — albeit very different — series, NBC’s Good Girls, as one of three suburban Detroit housewives who try to extricate themselves from desperate financial straits by teaming together to rob a grocery store, only to find themselves in hotter water than ever. "When this opportunity came up," she says, "I had to ask, 'Do I want to do this every day for potentially seven years?' And I looked at these two other women [costars Retta and Mae Whitman], and this writing and this tone, and it was so different. I loved the balance of the drama and the comedy, and being able to stretch my muscles or whatever, and play in comedy alongside the drama, which I would say most people know me for. And I thought, 'That would be fun to do every day.'"
